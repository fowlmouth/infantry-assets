~B~2Comprehensive Guide to Eol~B~2
--------------------------

~1*This guide is in place to help you get started on your new character in Eol and provide all players with some information. Something to take into consideration is to take a look at the Revision List located in the F1 Menu. Everything in place here is subjective, meaning it could change at any given time, without warning.*

~BDon't forget to read Descriptions, Information and Requirements on the particular Class/Item/Weapon you're purchasing.

The following are just minor examples, strategies, and informations inside this zone.

~B~2Getting Started~B
---------------

First what you want to do is check the F11 Menu. You'll notice the first two sections are for Attributes. You want to ignore these sections and the Command class section until you have some experience. Check out the Combat, Medical and Engineering trees for now.

The first classes you can choose from are Infantry (Combat Tree), Field Medic (Medical Tree), Combat Tech (Engineering Tree). I refer to these classes as "Grunt" classes. Your choice of class is very important at this point in time. If you choose Infantry, when you start getting attributes, enough of them, you'll be able to change to other classes within the Combat Tree. Same goes for Field Medic, you'll be able to change to the other Class in the Medical Tree, and so goes for the Engineering Tree. Since you're only allowed to choose between the classes in the Tree that you've chosen, you cannot change directly from one Tree's Grunt Class, to another. Check the *NOTE* for help on this if you've made a mistake by choosing a Tree that you didn't want to stick with. Here are some base stats to help you decide which to choose:

~B~4Combat Tree -- Infantry - ~2100 Base Hit Points, 5% Innate Protection against Kinetic, 40kg Base Weight, 550kJ Base Energy with 25kJ/s Base Energy Recharge, Combat Class -- Nearly always ready for Combat.
~4Medical Tree -- Field Medic - ~280 Base Hit Points, 25% Innate Protection against Chemical, 40kg Base Weight, 550kJ Base Energy with 25kJ/s Base Energy Recharge, Support Class -- Able to heal teammates.
~4Engineering Tree -- Combat Tech - ~280 Base Hit Points, 5% Innate Protection against Explosive, 50kg Base Weight, 550kJ Base Energy with 20kJ/s Base Energy Recharge, Support Class -- Able to build Turrets.~B

Your Starting equipment slightly varies from which class you choose. If you choose Infantry, you'll start with a Carbine, if you start with a Tech, or a Medic, you'll start with Titan Arms AP. In any case, any of those three classes will be given starting Armor when you choose them, Ceramax Combat Armor. This is not good armor, but it is not a priority to change it just yet. Your starting cash is 25,000. Changing to Infantry/Medic/Tech at any time, will deduct 5,000 cash. I'll get into how much each class costs later. Since you've chosen one of these three, you'll want to keep the starting equipment for now. The only thing you should purchase right away is a Suit SuperCharger, located in the F10 Store menu under the "Fighting-Suit" section. It costs 10,000 cash which leaves you with 10,000. Suit SuperCharger will boost your Energy Recharge Rate by 10kJ/s and you will need it. You can optionally grab a Melee weapon of your choosing to help accomplish what you're doing.~2

~0*NOTE*
~BIf you chose a Tree that you didn't want to stick with and you wanted to go into another field, you'll have to first acquire the attributes for the other class you were aiming for in the other Tree. Then you should aim to get the attributes that are required for a class in the same tree you're in. Once you've done that, change to that class that's in the same Tree as you're in, and sell all of your equipment, then switch to the Grunt class in the other Profession Tree, and from there switch to the class that you were working toward. If you do not sell your equipment before you transfer to a different Field of Profession/Grunt Class, the server will simply wipe your inventory, meaning you're basically losing cash during the whole process. Always sell your inventory when you're switching to a Grunt Class. That's the only time you have to.~B~0



~B~2Starting Strategy~B
-----------------

For any of the three starting classes, your goal is the same. You should focus on hunting Spiders as you don't have the attributes, or equipment to fend off other players. Spider Hives look like reasonably-sized holes in the ground and they send out 1-5 Spiders that damage you if they hit you. Adult Spiders look like stationary Spiders that shoot webs in your direction that will slow you down, or stop you if you come in contact with them. Spider Hives are the dangerous one, of the two. I'll explain why you hunt these when you start, and what you get for doing it in a little bit. For Medic and Tech, you'll want to use your Titan Arms AP from a short distance. This distance is something you need to determine and figure out for yourself. Hitting a Hive with 3 full Clips of Titan Arms AP will kill it. For Infantry, this is different. You do not want to waste your Carbine ammo on Spiders. There are two alternatives for this, from the beginning grab a Kamenev AP from the F10 Store under the "Projectile" section (it uses the same 9mm calibur round as your Carbine). The Kamenev AP can destroy a Spider Hive in 1 and 1/2 clips, or less. Medics and Techs can also purchase this weapon as an alternative as well. The other alternative for Infantry is just using the Hand to Hand suit-weapon on the Spider Hives. The Infantry strategy for that is running up within range and using strafe to strafe around the bugs. Fighting a lone Spider Hive is ideal and it can be done, repeatedly like this and you'll earn quite a bit of cash and experience, but it will eat you up right away. The reason you don't really want to spend your cash so close to the start of your character is because there really isn't much to buy at all. Saving your money will yield a lot of cash after a few Spider runs and then you can begin purchasing items and armors and grabbing attributes for better weapons.

Some weapons for exterminating Spiders between the Grunts would include:
~BWeapons-EM/Gauss -- Kuchler GSMG 202a -- Field Medic (+5 Technical & +2 Deftness)
Weapons-EM/Gauss -- Maklov Needler -- Field Medic (+5 Technical & +2 Deftness)

Spider Hives have 150 base Hit Points (invisible). When you kill them, they drop three Spider Gems, two Blue Gems and one Green Gem. The Blue Spider Gems are worth 250 Cash, 1 Experience and 5 Bounty. The Green Gem is worth 450 Cash, 5 Experience and 5 Bounty. Essentially, killing one Spider Hive and picking up all of the drops will yield a total of 950 Cash, 7 Experience and 15 Bounty. With any pickup that gives Bounty, you'll need to pick them up one at a time to get the full Bounty Prize. Groups of 2 or more being picked up all at once will only yield a Base Bounty Prize of what one pickup would be worth, however, this will not affect the Cash/Experience rewards for them, you'll get those no matter what.
Adult Spiders have 150 base Hit Points (invisible). When you kill them, they drop a Spider Husk and one Blue Gem. Spider Husks give 250 Cash, 25 Experience and 25 Bounty. You can accumulate 500 Cash, 26 Experience and 30 Bounty from grabbing all the drops from killing one Adult Spider.

There are two types of Spider Hives, one that shoots out 5 Spiders at a time and one that shoots out 1 Spider at a time. Both of these Hives yield the same drops. These Spiders cause Chemical/Toxin Damage to you as well as some Shield Drain. When you reach 28,000 cash, you'll want to get to the store and purchase Superior Filters under the "Fighting-Suit" section, again. These will help against that Chemical/Toxin Damage from Spiders. You can really stop hunting Spiders at anytime and try to take on something more difficult, but it isn't suggested quite yet. You'll want to get at LEAST 1-2 points in each Attribute off of hunting Spiders. Check the Attributes section for more info on them. This process can be slow and tiring if you aren't doing it right.

~B~5Common spawns for Spiders are at: A2,A3,B2,B3,B6,B10,B15,C6,E4,E5,G14,G15,H11,J9,N1,N2,Q13
~B
~2Ultimately, Spiders provide a great income and are not too difficult to handle. After you've gotten enough for your Superior Filters and your income is steady by continuing with the extermination, you can look into buying other things like Armors. Remember to read their descriptions, and the information there is about them, such as if there are any Speed Increases/Decreases, and what Protection, and Ignore that Armor gives. You'll be able to have 1 base armor (Soft, Composite, or Hard), two secondary armors (boots, or greaves and gauntlets, or vambrace), and field(s) (IDF, PF, Shock, Basic DF, Basic CS, Concussion, Enhanced DF, Enhanced CS, Enhanced PF).

When you've gotten enough Attributes for other weapons, that are able to take down Pirates, you could buy those, and continue your journey.

~B~2Grunt Overview~B
-----------

Infantry is a good starting choice. They have the biggest class selection tree, they'll be able to eventually fight 1v1 and have the most decent armor of the three grunts.

Field Medics are a rounded class, able to work up to healing teammates and beyond. Medic is the best Grunt class to use while hunting Spiders, since their boost in Chemical innate protection.

Combat Techs take a little more effort, of the three. They're hard working Engineers in-the-making. What they lack in skill, they make up for in brilliance. Tech are the least best fighting class, of the three Grunts.

~B~2Gameplay Types~B
--------------

In Eol there are several different types, or ways to earn what you need. You can hunt Spiders, Pirates, Players, participate in KOTH, or the Flag game. Once you've played Eol enough, all of these things become routine.

You already know about those first three listed, but what's KOTH and this Flag game? How does that work?

~BKOTH~B -- King of the Hill type play. This game is started when there are 5 or more players in-game, playing. When the game starts, everyone has a 'K' next to their name on the Playerlist on the right-side interface. You'll also notice a tiny heart to the left of your playing alias. Basically, when the game starts you need to try and keep that heart; survive until you, or your team is the last one with one. When this happens your team will recieve a reward. Timers are set to 5 minutes. When you kill other players, your timer resets to 5 minutes. You lose your heart when you die, but you can still win by either helping a teammate stay alive that still has a heart, or by killing two enemy players with hearts which will give you your's back. Some things that factor into how much rewards a team recieves are Kills, Flag Captures and the amount of players playing.

~BFlag Game~B -- Flag games start regardless of the amount of players playing. They last approximately 30 minutes and have their own set reward values. The amount of rewards you get are determined on things like Kills, Flag Captures, how many players are playing, etc. The rewards are never too huge, but it doesn't hurt to capture a few flags here, or there; kill a few here, or there.

In very low arena numbers, don't expect much of a reward off either of those. If this is the situation, just look at these two as something extra to do while you're hunting.



~BEnclave & Portals~B
-----------------

~6The Enclave is a huge compound where you can be safe, and buy your necessary equipment and supplies. This is also the area that you spawn in when you first unspec and when you die. There are many portals scattered around the Enclave. Most all of them send you to random locations, but there are 6 set-location portals located in roughly the L8 area of the compound. Here's a diagram to help you out:


~B    3   4   5   6

Relative Locations:
1 = Spawns at L12/M12

3 = Spawns at F2/G2
4 = Spawns at K1
5 = Spawns at O3/P3
6 = Spawns at A11/A12~B

If you were heading south to the mineral Fields, you'd take 1.
If you were headed to some of the Spider Spawns/Pirate Spawns/Player areas, you'd take 2.
If you were headed to the relative Pirate spawn to the north, you'd take 3.
If you were headed to the Airstrip, you'd take 4.
If you were headed to the Spider spawns far northeast, you'd take 5.
If you were headed to the Newbie Area to fight Pirates, you'd take 6.
