Please dont freak out, but I needed to reset the zone so I could get a handle on how difficult it is to level up now.

I made a bunch of small changes, as well as giving periodic rewards for flags held over time.

All energy weapons have a 50% momentum boost, ie: your forward/backward momentum imparts 50% of your speed to your projectile speeds.. This is the same as in CTF and WZA.

DropTrooper has HyperSpeed, press shift while moving.. It costs energy tho.

Made some small changes to the .cfg, specifically, you will get exp for kills, but it wont be much.  Also, you cannot switch teams.. Quit team hopping and get some skill.

As soon as I get the maps from rodvik, I will fix any map errors.

After leaving the academy zone you are shipped out to the front. For six months you and your squad mates have been in cold sleep.

You are awoken to the sound of alarms. You have encountered an enemy transport in deep space and a boarding action has occurred.

Your commander warns you to be careful. Rookies will sprint across the boarding ramp. Experienced soldiers will use the jetpacks and shuttle.

The objective of the zone is to capture the enemies ship while defending your own. 

There are SIX objectives to capture all visible on radar (left click on radar to see full screen).

You will notice that as you gain experience more classes become available for you to play.

This is a test zone which will be placed after the academy in the campaign. The skill system is a temporary test.

THERE IS NO STORE IN THIS ZONE - New items are aquired via picking a new role/class

IMPORTANT - Your character WILL be reset very often in this zone as changes will be occuring quickly. Dont get attached to them.
